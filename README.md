# Algolia Take-Home Search Project

This repository is to assist frequent flyers. With the help of Algolia technology, I have inserted a dataset compiled with airport information for fliers to arrive at their correct destination via search and information.

# What you will find in this repository:

- Language: Javascript(node.js), css
- Features: widgets, instantSearch, autoComplete

# Project Outline:
This project aimed to enhance the search experience for frequent flyers by integrating Algolia's search capabilities into the application. The goal here was to create a user-friendly search solution that helps travelers find and eventualy book flights. I utilized Algolia's API with Node.js on the backend and you are able to see the search on the frontend in real-time. Initially, I was not able to accomplish this task fully. Evaluating the bugs, I came down to the conclusion that the API was not connected properly and unable to complete the search request of the user. After waiting some time, the API search request completed 4/10. Successfully addressing all bugs, the performance worked properly and the search results came to life. 

# Customer Response:
Question 1: Hello,
I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."
Cheers, George

Answer 1: 
Hi George,

I'm excited to learn that you're using Algolia's search engine to broaden your knowledge of these concepts. I'll be more than happy to define this for you and assist you on your experience. 

Records are individual items that are searchable by the user. Upon searching for something within a dataset, you can think of your search as a record.

Indexing is the process of aligning and organizing those records/entries so that they can be searched quickly. Think of index as a folder in your computer where the files are the records. 

In regards to "Custom Ranking", that is completely up to you which is the beauty to it. What is important for your user and the experience you're trying to build? What are you looking to sell, teach, or show? Think of your user and what is most important to them. 

If all of this tracks, feel free to email me back with any further questions and or concepts you need further clarification for. 

Best,
Amanda Marcal

Question 2: Hello,
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.
Regards, Matt

Answer 2: 
Hi Matt,

I understand your frustration regarding this inconvenience. First and foremost, i'd like to take a moment to thank you for bringing this to our attention so that we may continue to better the user experience from feedback such as this one. I share the same frustrations when taking extra steps and clicks on an application I frequent, so i'll be more than happy to assist in any way so that we can minimize your click back when clearing and deleting indexes. Would you be available for a 30 minute meeting this week (Wed the 13th) so that we may address this over a zoom call?

Looking forward to your reply so that we may better your experience moving forward.
Best,
Amanda Marcal
